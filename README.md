# Trillo 

This is a project from a CSS course I took on Udemy (Advanced CSS and Sass by Jonas Schmedtmann), its not actually fully functional, it was really just meant to serve as practice for delving deeper into the world of CSS. 
However, this page is supposed to function as a landing page for a company that provides travel bookings, such as hotels, airlines, etc. Everything was done using only HTML and CSS.
